      <p>
        Sometimes I wonder if happiness has ever chosen me.  
        No matter how deeply I love, I always end up in partings  
        with the ones I thought would stay. The heartbreaks pile up,  
        silently—too heavy to carry, too fragile to tell.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Writing became the only place where I could leave  
        these unsaid words, where sorrow could exist without shame.  
        Every page I create is a reflection of the storms inside me,  
        a quiet confession dressed in letters.  
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are here, reading this, maybe you too have  
        carried a weight that no one else could see.  
        Maybe my words will echo a little of your silence,  
        and remind you that even broken hearts  
        still deserve to be heard.
