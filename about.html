        Hi, I’m the writer behind <strong>DX Atelier ∆</strong>.  
        These books are fragments of thoughts, feelings I never said,  
        and unsent letters that finally found a place to breathe.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I write because silence can be heavy,  
        and words—once shared—can become a bridge between lonely hearts.  
        If you’re here reading, know that you are already part of this quiet, unspoken world I’ve built.  
      </p>
      <p>— With love, The Author.</p>
